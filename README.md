Game Description
================

## Why is it important or interesting to you?
I have always been interested in 2D RPG games, having played many classics such as Pok√©mon since childhood. Those games sparked my imagination with their worlds, characters, and simple but engaging mechanics. After learning coding during school, I wanted to take what I learned and apply it to something meaningful to me.
By building a basic RPG from scratch, I can creatively practice programming concepts, while preparing myself for more complex projects in the future. My goal is not only to make a fun and playable game but also to strengthen my problem-solving and design skills.
